# D3373-A11_FP_ADPR
An pin adapter pcb for an Fujitsu D3373-A11 MB Front panel connector to standard 2.54mm pin headers for desktop case connector.


If I were to make a version two, I would change the pin-outs for the temprature sensor too a single row of 5pin so that an lm75 module could hang right off the pcb.
